# MonoalphabeticCipher
this is the project to break a monoalphabetic cipher. I have another repo for strictly a caesar cipher.
To find a key, you need to run a frequency analysis to obtain a character count, and then manually find the key. Create an instance of FrequencyAnalyzer to accomplish this. Once you have your counts, the key will be pretty easy to find since this is only dealing with monoalphabetic ciphers. Have fun with it and please feel free to contribute!
